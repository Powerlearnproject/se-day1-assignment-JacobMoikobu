Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and mantainance 
of high quality software systems. Software engineering is important to the technology industry because it provides a way to manage the
resources, schedule and budget of projects and ensuring the teams are effectively collaborating to deliver high quality software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering included:
1. Development of programming languages such as C and Fortran that were used to develop software applications.
2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s which helped in the growth of this discipline through research.
3. Introduction of structured programming in the 1970s which provided a lot of advantages like making programs easier to read and understand.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements gathering-refers to the process of collecting user requirements to ensure the developed system meets their needs.
2. Design-refers to the process of creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- refers to the process of building the software according to the specified designs and specifications.
4. Testing- refers to the process of testing the software to confirm whether it works as expected.
5. Deployment- refers to the process of availing the software to the end users.
6. Maintenance- refers to the process of continually ensuring the software works properly through providing updates and introducing new features.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a software development methodology in which activities are carried out sequentially with distinct phases while agile methodology
is a software development approach that is iterative and incremental focusing on flexibility, collaboration and accommodation of any changes.
Since waterfall model is sequential and has distinct phases its the most appropriate to use for small projects with well-defined requirements on the other 
hand due to the flexible nature of agile methodology its appropriate to use for large, complex and uncertain projects with evolving requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer- responsible for ensuring software quality and executing test plans.
Project manager- responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments provide tools for writing, debugging and testing code i.e Netbeans and Visual studio code.
Version Control Systems provide software development teams with tools to track software changes and and effectively collaborate during software development.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines- pressure to deliver software within short specified deadlines can lead to rushed development and compromised quality. Can be overcome by allocating enough
   time for development.
2.Changing requirements- changes during the development cycle can lead to delays hence affecting the projects. Can be overcome by clearly defining the project requirements before
  the beginning of development.
3. Technical debt- technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs. Can be overcome through proper software testing to address any shorcomings.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit integration- Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. Used to ensure different components interact seamlessly.
System testing- refers to the process of testing the entire system. Used to ensure the system meets the minimum requirements.
Acceptance testing- refers to the ptocess of testing whether the system meets the user requirements. Used to ensure the users are satisfied with the software product.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting inputs for language models to generate desired outputs effectively.
Prompt engineering is important because it helps AI models to deliver precise outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about climate change."

Improved prompt
"Explain the primary causes of climate change, focusing on the role of human activities, and discuss two major environmental impacts it has caused."
The improved prompt is more effective because it clearly asks for specific information such as primary causes of climate change.
